Water MAPP

An Intuitive App for Facility Managers to Grade their Water Efficiency Performance and Estimate Possible Savings.
 
This app was created during the 2013 Techcrunch hackathon in New York City. 

It uses the Appery.io platform to quickly prototype and build a cross-platform app on iOS, Android, and tablets.

It was also designed to solve the AT&T Developer challenge that was looking for an application that would help grade large building water efficiency.

Currently, only the Android source code was extracted.  If iOS is needed, please send me a message.

Thanks.
